--[ 1 - Introduction

    Listen up. You're looking at PORKCHOP - a pocket-sized WiFi hunting
    companion that lives in your M5Cardputer. Think pwnagotchi had a baby
    with a tamagotchi, except this one oinks and has zero chill when it
    catches a handshake.
    
    The piglet personality isn't just for show. It reacts to what you're
    doing - gets hyped when you pop a 4-way, goes full WARHOG when you're
    driving around mapping networks, and gets sleepy when nothing's
    happening. Feed it handshakes and it'll love you forever.


--[ 2 - What the hell is this thing

    PORKCHOP is built on the ESP32-S3 platform running on M5Cardputer
    hardware. It's designed for:

        - Passive WiFi reconnaissance
        - WPA/WPA2 handshake capture
        - GPS-enabled wardriving
        - ML-powered rogue AP detection
        - Looking cute while doing questionable things

    Your digital companion reacts to discoveries like any good attack pet
    should. Captures make it happy. Boredom makes it sad. It's basically
    you, but as an ASCII pig.


--[ 3 - Capabilities


----[ 3.1 - OINK Mode

    The bread and butter. Press 'O' and let the piglet loose:

        * Channel hopping across all 802.11 channels
        * Promiscuous mode packet capture  
        * EAPOL frame detection and 4-way handshake reconstruction
        * Deauth capability for... "authorized testing purposes"
        * Real-time ML classification of suspicious APs
        * Auto-attack mode cycles through targets automatically
        * Targeted deauth prioritizes discovered clients
        * PCAP export to SD for post-processing


----[ 3.2 - WARHOG Mode

    GPS + WiFi = tactical mapping. Hook up an AT6668 and go mobile:

        * Real-time GPS coordinate display on bottom bar
        * Automatic network discovery and logging
        * Memory-safe design (auto-saves at 2000 entries)
        * Feature extraction for ML training
        * Multiple export formats:
            - CSV: Simple, spreadsheet-ready
            - Wigle: Upload your wardriving data to wigle.net
            - Kismet NetXML: For your Kismet workflow
            - ML Training: 32-feature vectors for model training


----[ 3.3 - File Transfer Mode

    Need to grab those juicy PCAPs off your piglet? WiFi file transfer:

        * Connects to YOUR WiFi network (configure SSID/password in settings)
        * Black & white web interface at porkchop.local or device IP
        * Browse SD card directories (/handshakes, /wardriving, etc.)
        * Download captured handshakes and wardriving data
        * Upload files back to the piglet
        * No cables, no fuss

    Set your network creds in Settings before trying to connect or the
    pig will stare at you blankly wondering what you expected.


----[ 3.4 - Machine Learning

    PORKCHOP doesn't just capture - it thinks. The ML system extracts
    32 features from every beacon frame:

        * Signal characteristics (RSSI, noise patterns)
        * Beacon timing analysis (interval, jitter)
        * Vendor IE fingerprinting
        * Security configuration analysis
        * Historical behavior patterns

    Built-in heuristic classifier detects:

        [!] ROGUE_AP    - Strong signal + abnormal timing + missing IEs
        [!] EVIL_TWIN   - Hidden SSID + suspiciously strong signal
        [!] VULNERABLE  - Open/WEP/WPA1-only/WPS enabled
        [!] DEAUTH_TGT  - No WPA3 or PMF = free real estate

    Want real ML? Train your own model on Edge Impulse and drop it in.
    The scaffold is ready.


----[ 3.5 - Enhanced ML Mode

    Two collection modes for different threat models:

        BASIC MODE (default)
        ----------------------
        Uses ESP32 WiFi scan API. Fast. Reliable. Limited features.
        Good for casual wardriving when you just want the basics.

        ENHANCED MODE
        ----------------------
        Enables promiscuous beacon capture. Parses raw 802.11 frames.
        Extracts the juicy bits:

            * IE 0  (SSID)              - Catches all-null hidden SSIDs
            * IE 3  (DS Parameter Set)  - Real channel info
            * IE 45 (HT Capabilities)   - 802.11n fingerprinting
            * IE 48 (RSN)               - WPA2/WPA3, PMF, cipher suites
            * IE 50 (Extended Rates)    - Rate analysis
            * IE 221 (Vendor Specific)  - WPS, WPA1, vendor ID

        Higher CPU. More memory. More features. Worth it.

    Toggle in Settings: [ML Mode: Basic/Enhanced]

    Each network gets an anomalyScore 0.0-1.0 based on:

        * RSSI > -30 dBm         Suspiciously strong. Honeypot range.
        * Open or WEP encryption What year is it?
        * Hidden SSID            Something to hide?
        * Non-standard beacon    Not 100ms = software AP.
        * No HT capabilities     Ancient router or spoofed.
        * WPS on open network    Classic honeypot fingerprint.


--[ 4 - Hardware

    Required:
        * M5Cardputer (ESP32-S3 based)
        * MicroSD card for data storage

    Optional:
        * AT6668 GPS Module (WARHOG mode)
        * Questionable ethics


--[ 5 - Building & Flashing

    We use PlatformIO because we're not savages.

        # Install if you haven't
        $ pip install platformio

        # Build it
        $ pio run -e m5cardputer

        # Flash it
        $ pio run -t upload -e m5cardputer

        # Watch it work
        $ pio device monitor

    If it doesn't compile, skill issue. Check your dependencies.


--[ 6 - Controls

    The M5Cardputer's keyboard is tiny but functional:

        +-------+----------------------------------+
        | Key   | What it does                     |
        +-------+----------------------------------+
        | O     | OINK mode - start hunting        |
        | W     | WARHOG mode - start wardriving   |
        | S     | Settings menu                    |
        | `     | Toggle menu / Go back            |
        | ;     | Navigate up / Decrease value     |
        | .     | Navigate down / Increase value   |
        | Enter | Select / Toggle / Confirm        |
        | G0    | Bail out - return to IDLE        |
        +-------+----------------------------------+

    G0 is the physical button on the top side of the M5Cardputer.
    Press it anytime to bail out and return to IDLE. Useful when
    your piglet is going ham on someone's network.


----[ 6.1 - Screen Layout

    Your piglet's face lives on a 240x135 pixel canvas. Not much real
    estate, but enough to cause trouble.

    The piglet has moods. Watch the face change as it hunts:

        NEUTRAL     HAPPY       EXCITED     HUNTING     SLEEPY      SAD
         ?  ?        ^  ^        !  !        /  \        v  v        .  .
        (o 00)      (^ 00)      (@ 00)      (> 00)      (- 00)      (T 00)
        (    )      (    )      (    )      (    )      (    )      (    )

    Yes, we spent actual development time on pig facial expressions.
    No regrets.


----[ 6.2 - OINK Mode Screen

    Press O and let the piglet loose. Here's the hunting grounds:

        +----------------------------------------------+
        | [OINK]                         SD GPS WiFi   |  <- Top Bar
        +----------------------------------------------+
        |                                              |
        |       /  \      .------------------------.   |
        |      (> 00)  < | hunting truffles        |   |  <- Pig + Speech
        |      (    )     `------------------------'   |
        |    1010110110                                |  <- Animated grass
        |                                              |
        +----------------------------------------------+
        | N:42 HS:3 D:127 CH:6                    1:23 |  <- Stats + Uptime
        +----------------------------------------------+

    Bottom bar - the numbers that matter:

        N:42    = Snouts don't lie. 42 networks in range.
        HS:3    = 3 four-ways in the bag. Hashcat is waiting.
        D:127   = 127 frames of pure chaos unleashed.
        CH:6    = Currently sniffing channel 6.
        PWN:xxx = Trophy wall. Last victim's SSID.
        1:23    = How long piggy been running wild.

    The grass under piggy's feet tells you what's happening. When you
    see it scrolling, channel hopping is active - the snout is working.
    Static grass means the pig is chilling, waiting for orders.


----[ 6.3 - WARHOG Mode Screen

    GPS + WiFi = tactical recon. Hook up that GPS and hit the road:

        +----------------------------------------------+
        | [WARHOG]                       SD GPS WiFi   |  <- Top Bar
        +----------------------------------------------+
        |                                              |
        |       !  !      .------------------------.   |
        |      (@ 00)  < | hog on patrol           |   |  <- Excited piggy
        |      (    )     `------------------------'   |
        |    1110100111                                |  <- Grass moves when
        |                                              |     GPS has fix
        +----------------------------------------------+
        | U:128 S:45 [42.36,-71.05] S:7          12:45 |  <- GPS Stats
        +----------------------------------------------+

    Bottom bar - the wardriving scoreboard:

        U:128           = 128 unique APs mapped. New territory.
        S:45            = 45 entries written to SD. Receipts.
        [42.36,-71.05]  = You are here. Lat,lon.
        S:7             = 7 birds in the sky tracking you back.
        12:45           = Time on the hunt.

    The grass is your GPS indicator. Moving grass = fix acquired,
    coords are logging, you're making progress. Static grass = no fix,
    piggy is blind and sad, nothing getting saved with coords.

    When the fix locks, piggy goes "gps locked n loaded" and gets hyped.
    When you lose it, piggy sulks. The grass never lies.


--[ 7 - Configuration

    Settings persist to SPIFFS. Your piglet remembers.

        +------------+-------------------------------+---------+
        | Setting    | Description                   | Default |
        +------------+-------------------------------+---------+

        +------------+-------------------------------+---------+


--[ 8 - ML Training Pipeline

    Want to train your own model? Here's the workflow:

----[ 8.1 - Data Collection

    WARHOG mode automatically collects ML training data. No extra steps.

    How it works:
        - Every network gets 32 features extracted from beacon frames
        - Data accumulates in memory as you drive around
        - Every 60 seconds, WARHOG dumps to /ml_training.csv - crash protection
        - When you stop WARHOG (G0 button), final export happens
        - Worst case you lose 1 minute of data if piggy crashes

    The dump contains:
        BSSID, SSID, channel, RSSI, authmode, HT caps, vendor IEs,
        beacon interval, jitter, GPS coords, timestamp, and label

    Set ML Mode to Enhanced in settings for deep beacon parsing.
    Basic mode uses ESP32 scan API. Enhanced mode sniffs raw 802.11.
    More features, more CPU, more fun.

----[ 8.2 - Labeling

    Raw data starts unlabeled. Use the prep script to auto-label based
    on security characteristics:

        $ python scripts/prepare_ml_data.py ml_training.csv

    The script outputs ml_training_ei.csv with string labels:

        normal        = Legit ISP routers, standard secure configs
        rogue_ap      = Strong signal + suspicious characteristics
        evil_twin     = Impersonating known network - label manually
        deauth_target = No WPA3/PMF - free real estate
        vulnerable    = Open/WEP/WPS enabled

    The auto-labeler catches the obvious stuff. For real rogue/evil twin
    samples, you gotta set up sketchy APs in the lab and label manually.
    Upload your labeled CSV to Edge Impulse for training.

----[ 8.3 - Training on Edge Impulse

    Edge Impulse handles the heavy lifting:

        1. Create project at studio.edgeimpulse.com
        2. Upload your labeled ml_training.csv
        3. Design impulse: Raw data block -> Classification (Keras)
        4. Train for 50+ epochs, check confusion matrix
        5. Test on held-out data, iterate if needed

    Aim for 90%+ accuracy before deploying. Your piggy deserves
    a brain that actually works.

----[ 8.4 - Deployment

    When your model is ready:

        1. Export as "C++ Library" targeting ESP32
        2. Extract edge-impulse-sdk/ into porkchop/lib/
        3. Open src/ml/edge_impulse.h
        4. Uncomment: #define EDGE_IMPULSE_ENABLED
        5. Rebuild and flash

    Now your piglet runs real inference instead of heuristics.
    The grass still moves the same way, but the brain got an upgrade.
