--[ 1 - Introduction

    Listen up. You're looking at PORKCHOP - a pocket-sized WiFi hunting
    companion that lives in your M5Cardputer. Think pwnagotchi had a baby
    with a tamagotchi, except this one oinks and has zero chill when it
    catches a handshake.
    
    The piglet personality isn't just for show. It reacts to what you're
    doing - gets hyped when you pop a 4-way, goes full WARHOG when you're
    driving around mapping networks, and gets sleepy when nothing's
    happening. Feed it handshakes and it'll love you forever.


--[ 2 - What the hell is this thing

    PORKCHOP is built on the ESP32-S3 platform running on M5Cardputer
    hardware. It's designed for:

        - Passive WiFi reconnaissance
        - WPA/WPA2 handshake capture
        - GPS-enabled wardriving
        - ML-powered rogue AP detection
        - Looking cute while doing questionable things

    Your digital companion reacts to discoveries like any good attack pet
    should. Captures make it happy. Boredom makes it sad. It's basically
    you, but as an ASCII pig.


--[ 3 - Capabilities


----[ 3.1 - OINK Mode

    The bread and butter. Press 'O' and let the piglet loose:

        * Channel hopping across all 802.11 channels
        * Promiscuous mode packet capture  
        * EAPOL frame detection and 4-way handshake reconstruction
        * Deauth capability for... "authorized testing purposes"
        * Real-time ML classification of suspicious APs
        * Auto-attack mode cycles through targets automatically
        * Targeted deauth prioritizes discovered clients
        * PCAP export to SD for post-processing


----[ 3.2 - WARHOG Mode

    GPS + WiFi = tactical mapping. Hook up an AT6668 and go mobile:

        * Real-time GPS coordinate display on bottom bar
        * Automatic network discovery and logging
        * Memory-safe design (auto-saves at 2000 entries)
        * Feature extraction for ML training
        * Multiple export formats:
            - CSV: Simple, spreadsheet-ready
            - Wigle: Upload your wardriving data to wigle.net
            - Kismet NetXML: For your Kismet workflow
            - ML Training: 32-feature vectors for model training


----[ 3.3 - File Transfer Mode

    Need to grab those juicy PCAPs off your piglet? WiFi file transfer:

        * Creates WiFi AP with configurable SSID/password
        * Black & white web interface at porkchop.local or 192.168.4.1
        * Browse SD card directories (/handshakes, /wardriving, etc.)
        * Download captured handshakes and wardriving data
        * Upload files back to the piglet
        * No cables, no fuss


----[ 3.4 - Machine Learning

    PORKCHOP doesn't just capture - it thinks. The ML system extracts
    32 features from every beacon frame:

        * Signal characteristics (RSSI, noise patterns)
        * Beacon timing analysis (interval, jitter)
        * Vendor IE fingerprinting
        * Security configuration analysis
        * Historical behavior patterns

    Built-in heuristic classifier detects:

        [!] ROGUE_AP    - Strong signal + abnormal timing + missing IEs
        [!] EVIL_TWIN   - Hidden SSID + suspiciously strong signal
        [!] VULNERABLE  - Open/WEP/WPA1-only/WPS enabled
        [!] DEAUTH_TGT  - No WPA3 or PMF = free real estate

    Want real ML? Train your own model on Edge Impulse and drop it in.
    The scaffold is ready.


----[ 3.5 - Enhanced ML Mode

    Two collection modes for different threat models:

        BASIC MODE (default)
        ----------------------
        Uses ESP32 WiFi scan API. Fast. Reliable. Limited features.
        Good for casual wardriving when you just want the basics.

        ENHANCED MODE
        ----------------------
        Enables promiscuous beacon capture. Parses raw 802.11 frames.
        Extracts the juicy bits:

            * IE 0  (SSID)              - Catches all-null hidden SSIDs
            * IE 3  (DS Parameter Set)  - Real channel info
            * IE 45 (HT Capabilities)   - 802.11n fingerprinting
            * IE 48 (RSN)               - WPA2/WPA3, PMF, cipher suites
            * IE 50 (Extended Rates)    - Rate analysis
            * IE 221 (Vendor Specific)  - WPS, WPA1, vendor ID

        Higher CPU. More memory. More features. Worth it.

    Toggle in Settings: [ML Mode: Basic/Enhanced]

    Each network gets an anomalyScore (0.0-1.0) based on:

        * RSSI > -30 dBm         (suspiciously strong)
        * Open or WEP encryption (lol what year is it)
        * Hidden SSID            (something to hide?)
        * Non-standard beacon    (not 100ms = sketchy)
        * No HT capabilities     (router from 2007?)
        * WPS on open network    (honeypot fingerprint)


--[ 4 - Hardware

    Required:
        * M5Cardputer (ESP32-S3 based)
        * MicroSD card for data storage

    Optional:
        * AT6668 GPS Module (WARHOG mode)
        * Questionable ethics


--[ 5 - Building & Flashing

    We use PlatformIO because we're not savages.

        # Install if you haven't
        $ pip install platformio

        # Build it
        $ pio run -e m5cardputer

        # Flash it
        $ pio run -t upload -e m5cardputer

        # Watch it work
        $ pio device monitor

    If it doesn't compile, skill issue. Check your dependencies.


--[ 6 - Controls

    The M5Cardputer's keyboard is tiny but functional:

        +-------+----------------------------------+
        | Key   | What it does                     |
        +-------+----------------------------------+
        | O     | Enter OINK mode (hunting)        |
        | W     | Enter WARHOG mode (wardriving)   |
        | S     | Settings menu                    |
        | `     | Toggle menu / Go back            |
        | ;     | Navigate up / Decrease value     |
        | .     | Navigate down / Increase value   |
        | Enter | Select / Toggle / Confirm        |
        | G0    | Return to IDLE from any mode     |
        +-------+----------------------------------+

    G0 is the physical button on the top side of the M5Cardputer.
    Press it anytime to bail out and return to IDLE. Useful when
    your piglet is going ham on someone's network.


--[ 6.1 - Screen Layout

    The 240x135 display is split into three regions:

    +----------------------------------------+
    | [OINK]                     SD GPS WiFi | <- Top Bar (14px)
    +----------------------------------------+
    |                                        |
    |      ?  ?     ,----------------------. |
    |     (o 00) < | *sniff sniff*         | | <- Main Canvas
    |     (    )   | Found something tasty!| |    (107px)
    |              `----------------------'  |
    |                                        |
    +----------------------------------------+
    | N:42  HS:3  D:127         CH:6  -45dBm | <- Bottom Bar (14px)
    +----------------------------------------+

    The piglet has moods. Here's the emotional range:

        NEUTRAL     HAPPY       HUNTING     SLEEPY      SAD
         ?  ?        ^  ^        /  \        v  v        .  .
        (o 00)      (^ 00)      (> 00)      (- 00)      (T 00)
        (    )      (    )      (    )      (    )      (    )

    Top Bar:    Mode indicator [OINK/WARHOG], status icons
    Main:       Derpy piglet + speech bubble with phrases
    Bottom:     Stats (Networks/Handshakes/Deauths, Channel, RSSI)


--[ 7 - Configuration

    Settings persist to SPIFFS. Your piglet remembers.

        +------------+-------------------------------+---------+
        | Setting    | Description                   | Default |
        +------------+-------------------------------+---------+
        | Sound      | Beeps when things happen      | ON      |
        | Brightness | Display brightness            | 80%     |
        | CH Hop     | Channel hop interval (ms)     | 500     |
        | Scan Time  | Per-channel scan duration     | 2000    |
        | Deauth     | Enable deauth attacks         | ON      |
        | GPS        | Enable GPS module             | ON      |
        | GPS PwrSave| Power saving for GPS          | ON      |
        | ML Mode    | Basic/Enhanced beacon capture | Basic   |
        +------------+-------------------------------+---------+


--[ 8 - ML Training Pipeline

    Want to train your own model? Here's the workflow:

    Step 1: Collect data
        - Run WARHOG mode in various environments
        - Let it build up a nice dataset
        - Export ML training data to SD card

    Step 2: Label your data
        - 0 = unknown (unlabeled)
        - 1 = normal (legitimate APs)
        - 2 = rogue_ap (suspicious)
        - 3 = evil_twin (impersonating)
        - 4 = vulnerable (weak security)

    Step 3: Train on Edge Impulse
        - Create project at studio.edgeimpulse.com
        - Upload your labeled CSV
        - Design impulse: Raw data -> Neural Network
        - Train, test, iterate

    Step 4: Deploy
        - Export as "C++ Library" for ESP32
        - Drop edge-impulse-sdk/ into lib/
        - Uncomment EDGE_IMPULSE_ENABLED
        - Rebuild and flash

    Now your piglet has a real brain.

--[ 10 - Legal sh*t

    LISTEN CAREFULLY.

    This tool is for AUTHORIZED SECURITY RESEARCH and EDUCATIONAL
    PURPOSES ONLY.

        * Only use on networks YOU OWN or have EXPLICIT WRITTEN PERMISSION
        * Deauth attacks are ILLEGAL in most jurisdictions without consent
        * Wardriving laws vary by location - know your local regulations
        * The authors assume ZERO LIABILITY for misuse
        * Don't be an a**hole

    If you use this to pwn your neighbor's WiFi, you deserve whatever
    happens to you. We made a cute pig, not a get-out-of-jail-free card.
